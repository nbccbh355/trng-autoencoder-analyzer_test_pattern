## About this fork
This fork extends the original TRNG autoencoder analyzer
to experiment with raw TRNG test patterns prior to encoding.
An additional `trng.py` module is used to explore pattern-level
entropy anomalies before feeding data into the autoencoder model.

## Quick usage
```bash
python trng.py --input sample.bin --out out --save-heatmap --no-ae

TRNG Autoencoder Analysis – Documentation
========================================

This repository provides a public technical presentation (PPTX file)
describing a conceptual framework for evaluating True Random Number
Generator (TRNG) entropy quality using NIST SP800-90B principles and
an Autoencoder-based residual inspection approach.

Purpose
-------

The purpose of this repository is to make the methodology explanation
and related research notes publicly accessible.  
This allows external verification, timestamped publication, and a
permanent public record of the work.

Repository Contents
-------------------

AE_SP80090B_Safe_v2.pptx  
A technical slide deck covering:
- Motivation for applying machine learning techniques to TRNG analysis
- Summary of SP800-90B entropy-related concepts  
  (collision tests, symbol frequency, estimator considerations)
- A conceptual Autoencoder residual analysis idea for identifying
  potential patterns or anomalies in TRNG output data
- Discussion of how statistical and AI-based inspection can complement
  each other in TRNG quality evaluation
