# Pattern-Level Observations

This note summarizes observations made after inspecting raw TRNG test patterns
using the preprocessing script provided in this repository.

## Summary

- No abnormal long repetition runs were observed in the tested bitstream.
- Adaptive proportion results remained within expected statistical bounds.
- Pattern-level inspection provides an intuitive complement to formal
  SP800-90B health tests.

## Remarks

While all health tests passed, visual and pattern-level analysis remains useful
for early anomaly detection prior to full statistical qualification.

These results are intended for exploratory analysis and learning purposes.
